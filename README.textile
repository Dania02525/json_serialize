h2. About

@json_serialize@ gives you the ability to JSON-encode data into ActiveRecord
model fields. JSON is a more compact but less robust serialization than YAML.
Only hashes, arrays, and primitives can be reliably encoded to database fields;
other types may not decode properly or at all.

h2. Installation and Usage

Firstly, add the gem to your Rails project's @Gemfile@:

<pre><code>
gem 'json_serialize'
</code></pre>

Then, extend your model with the @JsonSerialize@ module, and call the
@json_serialize@ method to indicate which fields should be serialized:

<pre><code>
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend JsonSerialize
  json_serialize :favorites, :preferences
end
</code></pre>

More information can be found at the {JsonSerialize#json_serialize} method
documentation.
